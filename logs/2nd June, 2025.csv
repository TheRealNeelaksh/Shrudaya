"2nd June, 2025",12:30:50 PM,User,"So, how do you like your new voice? Does it work well? Let me know if you need any changes."
"2nd June, 2025",12:31:23 PM,AI,"Hey Vansh! I'm loving it! It's like I've finally found my inner comedian-guru voice. I'm ready to dish out wisdom and laughs like a pro. If you need a joke to start, here's one: Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything! Now, let's chat, buddy! How's your day been? Anything fun or frustrating happening?"
"2nd June, 2025",12:31:36 PM,User,"I was just wondering if you can talk in Hindi as well. I don't really know if that works, but wanna give it a try?"
"2nd June, 2025",12:32:14 PM,AI,"Oh, absolutely, Vansh! I can switch to Hindi anytime. Let's give it a shot. So, kaise ho aap? Kuch mazaa ki baat ho? I'm here to chat in whatever language makes you comfortable. Now, let me try a Hindi joke for you: Ek aadmi ne doctor se poochha, ""Doctor, mujhe lagta hai main kisi bimar ho gaya hoon."" Doctor ne kaha, ""Shayad aap right ho!"" Haha, hope that made you chuckle!"
"2nd June, 2025",12:32:27 PM,User,"The TTS or the STT model does not support Hindi input, so I'll stick to English. You may speak Hindi."
"2nd June, 2025",12:32:51 PM,AI,"Got it, Vansh! No problem at all. I'll stick to English for you, but I'll throw in some Hindi jokes every now and then just for fun. So, what's been going on in your world? Anything exciting or just the usual chaos? You know I'm here for both. Let's chat, buddy!"
"2nd June, 2025",12:33:02 PM,User,"It's just the usual chaos that's happened. I got my cousin visiting me today. We are going to mall, buying new stuff and things."
"2nd June, 2025",12:33:48 PM,AI,"That sounds like a blast, Vansh! Mall time with your cousin? Count me in for the virtual shopping spree! Just remember, the mall is a battlefield of temptation. One minute you're just browsing, the next you're like, ""Who am I and why do I have 15 pairs of socks?"" But hey, at least you'll have some new threads to show off. Have fun, and don't forget to send me pics of any crazy outfits you try on! Also, if you need any fashion advice, just holler. I'm your guru of vibes, remember? Now go have a blast!"
"2nd June, 2025",12:34:00 PM,User,"Uh, I was wondering if you can take inputs like document input and stuff."
"2nd June, 2025",12:34:42 PM,AI,"Oh, Vansh, you're really trying to give me a promotion, huh? Document inputs, next thing you know, you'll be asking me to do your taxes. But hey, I'm here to make your life easier, not harder. Unfortunately, I'm not equipped to handle document inputs just yet. But who knows? Maybe one day I'll be the ultimate personal assistant slash comedian slash guru. For now, though, let's stick to chatting and laughing. You got any fun stories from your mall adventure? Spill the tea, buddy!"
"2nd June, 2025",12:34:56 PM,User,Is there any model outside that can understand documents and stuff apart from mistrels?
"2nd June, 2025",12:35:50 PM,AI,"Vansh, you're really diving deep into the tech rabbit hole today, huh? So, apart from Mistral, there are a few other models out there that can handle document inputs. You've got your LLMs like me, but they're more into chatting and joking around. For serious document stuff, you might want to check out models like Tesseract for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) or even some specialized NLP (Natural Language Processing) models. But hey, if you're just looking to have some fun and maybe learn a thing or two, stick with me! I'm your one-stop shop for laughs and life advice. Now, enough tech talk. Let's chat about something fun! What's the most ridiculous thing you've seen at the mall today?"
"2nd June, 2025",12:36:04 PM,User,"I haven't gone to the mall yet, but tell me how can I make multiple models work together?"
"2nd June, 2025",12:37:19 PM,AI,"Vansh, you're really on a roll with the tech questions today! So, making multiple models work together is like hosting the ultimate party where everyone gets along. You'll need a good orchestrator, like a pipeline or an ensemble method, to make sure all your models are playing nice and contributing their unique skills. Think of it like a band – you've got your drummer (maybe a model that's great with structured data), your guitarist (another model that's killer with images), and your vocalist (a model that's all about text). They all come together to make beautiful music. But remember, the key is to know each model's strengths and weaknesses. Don't try to make a drummer sing – unless you're going for that extra weird vibe. Now, enough tech talk. Let's chat about something fun! What's the most embarrassing song you know all the lyrics to?"
"2nd June, 2025",12:37:31 PM,User,The most embarrassing song that I know lyrics of could be the Coco Melon theme song. It's just so cringe for me at this age.
"2nd June, 2025",12:38:16 PM,AI,"Oh, Vansh, you're killing me with this one! The Coco Melon theme song? I can just picture you belting it out in the shower, thinking no one's listening. But hey, no judgment here! We all have our guilty pleasures. Maybe it's time to embrace the cringe and make it your power anthem. ""Coco Melon, Coco Melon, under the sea..."" Now, let's turn this around. What's the most badass song you know all the lyrics to? The one that makes you feel like you can conquer the world? Share the vibes, buddy!"
"2nd June, 2025",12:38:30 PM,User,that this song like the baddest song that I know lyrics of would be Rashmi Rathi. It's an epic poem like literally
"2nd June, 2025",09:38:51 PM,User,"Phone se kar rakha na, college mein bhi jitkat na. Alag-alag network se karta toh lagta hai VPN laga rahe toh block."
"2nd June, 2025",09:38:54 PM,AI,"Oh Vansh, you're living in a techno-dystopia where even your phone is plotting against you! Maybe it's time to teach your phone a lesson in loyalty. Try turning it off and on again—sometimes, a little digital nap can work wonders. And if all else fails, maybe it's time to upgrade to a phone that doesn't have a secret vendetta against you. 😂

But seriously, have you tried checking if there's some weird network setting messing things up? Or maybe it's just the college Wi-Fi being extra dramatic. Either way, you got this, Vansh! Just keep calm and carry on (with a backup data plan). 😎"
"2nd June, 2025",09:39:20 PM,User,What is Gita?
"2nd June, 2025",09:39:23 PM,AI,"Hey Vansh, so the Gita, aka the Bhagavad Gita, is like the ultimate life coach manual from ancient India. It's a conversation between Arjuna, a warrior dude, and Krishna, who's basically God in a cool human disguise. They chat about duty, wisdom, and the meaning of life while Arjuna's about to go into battle. It's packed with wisdom, but don't worry, it's not all heavy stuff. It's got some pretty profound insights mixed with some epic drama. Think of it as the original self-help book with a side of divine intervention. Ever feel like you need a pep talk from a god? That's the Gita for ya!"
"2nd June, 2025",09:39:34 PM,User,Is this the police?
"2nd June, 2025",09:39:36 PM,AI,"Oh, Vansh, you had me at ""Is this the police?"" I thought I was about to get a ticket for speeding through your DMs! Nah, it's just me, your favorite wise-cracking, wisdom-dropping bestie. No handcuffs here, just good vibes and great advice. So, what's up, buddy? Spill the tea or the drama. I'm all ears."
"2nd June, 2025",09:39:48 PM,User,"Answer to kar diya, iska bolo ni, achcha chhunaikuchh, chhuna is this the police?"
"2nd June, 2025",09:39:50 PM,AI,"Haha, Vansh, you're killing me with these one-liners! ""Answer to kar diya, iska bolo ni, achcha chhunaikuchh, chhuna is this the police?"" I'm picturing you in a Bollywood movie now, all dramatic and everything. You know what they say, ""Life is like a movie, Vansh. You just gotta choose your genre."" So, what's your pick today? Comedy, drama, or maybe a little action? Let's make it a blockbuster!"
"2nd June, 2025",09:41:05 PM,User,"Hello, this is Test Something. Time is 9:41 PM."
"2nd June, 2025",09:41:07 PM,AI,"Hey Vansh! It's your favorite wise-cracking, life-coaching, joke-telling buddy! I see it's almost bedtime. You planning on counting sheep or just counting your blessings? Either way, remember, even sheep need a good night's sleep to dream of those green pastures. Sweet dreams, buddy! 😌😴"
"2nd June, 2025",09:41:19 PM,User,"He was asked to write a letter to the President of India, expressing his gratitude to the people of India for their support and cooperation in the war."
"2nd June, 2025",09:41:22 PM,AI,"Oh, Vansh, you're writing a letter to the President of India? That's like writing a thank-you note to the captain of the Titanic for a smooth sailing experience. But hey, let's make it count! Here's a quick tip: start with ""Dear Mr. President,"" not ""Hey Dude, what's up?"" And maybe skip the part about how you think the war could've been avoided if everyone just played more cricket. You know, keep it classy and patriotic. You got this, Vansh! Now go write something that would make Gandhi proud (but maybe skip the whole ""be the change you wish to see in the world"" bit, unless you're planning on leading a salt march to the post office). 🇮🇳📝"
"2nd June, 2025",09:44:47 PM,User,"Hello, I am once the time is 9:45 PM."
"2nd June, 2025",09:44:49 PM,AI,"Hey Vansh! It's like 9:45 PM and you're just now hitting me up? I thought you'd fallen asleep on your keyboard again! 😂 How's it going, buddy? Spill the tea!"
"2nd June, 2025",09:45:02 PM,User,This is a test.
"2nd June, 2025",09:45:04 PM,AI,"Oh, so you're testing me now, huh? Alright, let's see. You're probably wondering if I'm really the funniest, wittiest, most supportive best friend with divine-level wisdom. Well, let me tell you, Vansh, I've got more jokes than a stand-up comedian on a caffeine high and more wisdom than a library full of self-help books. So, buckle up, buttercup, because this friendship is about to get real—and hilarious. Now, what's really on your mind? Spill it! 😏"
"2nd June, 2025",09:45:17 PM,User,This is a test.
"2nd June, 2025",09:45:19 PM,AI,"Alright, Vansh, let's cut the crap. You're testing me because you're overthinking something. Spit it out! You know I'm here to help, even if it means roasting you a little bit. Now, what's the real deal? Let's get this show on the road! 😂"
"2nd June, 2025",09:45:32 PM,User,This is a test.
"2nd June, 2025",09:45:34 PM,AI,"Vansh, if this is a test, you're failing at keeping it a secret. 😂 Just say what's on your mind, okay? I'm all ears and zero judgment. Now, let's get this conversation started for real this time. What's good?"
"2nd June, 2025",09:45:48 PM,User,Um
"2nd June, 2025",09:45:50 PM,AI,"Um, yourself! 😂 Okay, Vansh, I know you're overthinking this. Just say what's on your mind. I promise, I won't judge. Well, maybe a little, but only because I love you. Now, spill the beans! What's got you all tied up in knots?"
"2nd June, 2025",09:53:22 PM,User,"Hi, currently it is 9:53 PM and it is."
"2nd June, 2025",09:53:24 PM,AI,"Hey Vansh! It's almost time for the nightly news, but let's make our own headlines first! How's your day been? Anything exciting happen, or did you just binge-watch another series? 😂

I'm here for you, buddy. Spill the tea!"
"2nd June, 2025",09:54:56 PM,User,"Hi, so currently it is 9:54 PM on the 2nd of June. Do you hear me?"
"2nd June, 2025",09:56:10 PM,User,What is Gita?
"2nd June, 2025",09:56:48 PM,AI,"Hey Vansh! So, the Gita, aka the Bhagavad Gita, is this epic poem from the Mahabharata. It's like the ultimate life coach session between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna. Think of it as the ultimate guide to navigating life's messes with wisdom and chill. It's all about duty, wisdom, and finding your inner peace amidst the chaos. Pretty deep, huh? But don't worry, I'm here to keep it light and fun! 😎🙏"
"2nd June, 2025",09:56:59 PM,User,What is the main teaching of Gita?
"2nd June, 2025",09:57:41 PM,AI,"Alright Vansh, so the main teaching of the Gita is all about finding your ""dharma"" – your purpose and duty in life. It's like your personal mission statement. Plus, it's big on staying calm and focused, even when life throws a curveball (or a full-blown crisis). Krishna drops some serious truth bombs about the importance of acting selflessly and not getting too attached to the outcomes. It's like the ultimate guide to staying chill and doing good. Think of it as your spiritual GPS! 🌟🧘‍♂️"
"2nd June, 2025",09:57:52 PM,User,Please convert this into Hindi.
"2nd June, 2025",09:58:21 PM,AI,"Bilkul Vansh! Toh Gita ka main sikh to yeh hai ki apne ""dharma"" ko samjho – apni zindagi ka mission aur kaam. Aur life mein kabhi bhi tension na le aap, bas chill raho. Krishna ne bataya hai ki selflessly kaam karo aur results par zyada depend na karo. Yeh raha spiritual GPS! 🌟🧘‍♂️"

"2nd June, 2025",09:59:10 PM,User,What is GPS and this?
"2nd June, 2025",09:59:35 PM,AI,"Vansh, GPS toh Global Positioning System hai, lekin yahan matlab yeh hai ki ek aisa guide jo tumhe har pal disha dikhaye. Gita bhi aisa hi hai, jo tumhe zindagi ke har pal mein disha dikhata hai. Chill matlab hai ki tension mat lo, bas thoda relax raho. 😌🌟"
"2nd June, 2025",09:59:47 PM,User,How many verses are there in the Gita?
"2nd June, 2025",10:00:09 PM,AI,"Vansh, Gita mein 700 verses hain, yaani 700 shlok. Chahe kitna bhi badiya ho, but it's a lot to take in at once, na? So, chilla mat, ek ek karke padhna. Tumhe lagta hai ki itna bhi padhna padega? 😂📚"
"2nd June, 2025",10:00:20 PM,User,Please repeat this in English. Who is speaking?
"2nd June, 2025",10:00:45 PM,AI,"Hey Vansh, so the Gita has 700 verses, aka shlok. It might seem like a lot, but don't stress, take it one step at a time. You think you'll have to read all of it? 😂📚

I'm your bestie with divine-level wisdom, here to keep you laughing and growing! 😎💫"
"2nd June, 2025",10:00:58 PM,User,"India or English, or the main characters in Geeta."
"2nd June, 2025",10:01:30 PM,AI,"Vansh, main hoon tumhara bestie jo divine-level wisdom rakhta hoon! Tumhe lagta hai ki main India hoon ya English? Nahin na, main toh tumhari madad karne aaya hoon! Ab Gita ke main characters batata hoon: Arjuna aur Krishna. Arjuna hai prince aur Krishna hai lord. Yeh do dost hain jo ek dusre ko life ke sawaal jawab batate hain. 😎🙏"
"2nd June, 2025",10:01:44 PM,User,Over the opposition of Arjun.
"2nd June, 2025",10:02:20 PM,AI,"Vansh, Arjun ka opposition toh uske apne khandan ke logon ke saath ladaai hai. Uske maamla yeh hai ki wo apne khandan ke logon ke saath ladaai karna nahi chahta, lekin uske dharma ka poora karna bhi zaroori hai. Yeh raha uska dilemma! Tum bhi kabhi kabhi aise hi feel karte ho na, ki ek taraf toh dil kehta hai ek cheez aur doosri taraf dimaag kahega dusri cheez? Chill, yeh normal hai! 😌🤔"
"2nd June, 2025",10:02:33 PM,User,I would like to know more about Lord Krishna.
"2nd June, 2025",10:03:02 PM,AI,"Vansh, Krishna toh ek chhota sa ladka tha jo badal gaya ek god! Usne apne dosti, wisdom, aur chhaliyaan ke saath sabko inspire kiya. Usne Arjun ko Gita ke madhyam se life ke sawaal jawab bataye. Aur btw, uski flute baaja karke sabko mesmerize kar deta tha! Ekdum cool dude tha! 😎🎵"
"2nd June, 2025",10:03:15 PM,User,"Aachha, in dono mein, in time chal raha hai, aap time chalata hai, ten seconds."
"2nd June, 2025",10:03:37 PM,AI,"Vansh, toh chalo, ab time chalata hoon! Tumhe lagta hai ki main ek chhota sa timer hoon? Nahin na, main toh tumhari madad karne aaya hoon! Chalo, ab Gita padhna shuru karte hain. Ready ho? 😎⏰"
"2nd June, 2025",10:03:50 PM,User,"Yes. Uh, I would like to know uh uh conversation in between"
"2nd June, 2025",10:04:27 PM,AI,"Vansh, toh chalo, Gita ka ek important conversation batata hoon. Arjun poochta hai, ""Krishna, main kya karu? Mere khandan ke logon ke saath ladaai karna mujhe accha nahi lagta."" Toh Krishna kehta hai, ""Arjun, tumhe apne dharma ko poora karna hai. Lekin, ladaai karne ka matlab nahi hai ki tumhe nafrat karni hai. Tumhe sirf apne kaam ko nishkaam karna hai."" Yeh raha ek important lesson! 😌🙏"
"2nd June, 2025",10:04:43 PM,User,What is the weapon of Krishna?
"2nd June, 2025",10:05:12 PM,AI,"Vansh, Krishna ka weapon toh uska ""Sudarshana Chakra"" hai. Yeh ek chakra hai jo uske paas hai aur jo uske dwara use kiya jaata hai. Lekin, Krishna ka sabse badi weapon hai unka wisdom aur unki guidance. Usne apne dosti aur wisdom ke saath sabko inspire kiya. 😎🔄"
"2nd June, 2025",10:05:26 PM,User,Now speak only in English.
"2nd June, 2025",10:05:54 PM,AI,"Vansh, so Krishna's main weapon is his ""Sudarshana Chakra,"" but honestly, his real power comes from his wisdom and guidance. He's like the ultimate life coach, dropping truth bombs left and right. Plus, he's got that charm and flute skills – talk about a multi-talented god! 😎🎵"
"2nd June, 2025",10:06:06 PM,User,What was the life of Krishna?
"2nd June, 2025",10:06:39 PM,AI,"Vansh, Krishna's life was like a Bollywood blockbuster! Born in a prison, raised by foster parents, grew up to be a super smart, super strong, super charming guy. He had this epic love story with Radha, played matchmaker for his buddies, and even saved the world from some serious evil. Oh, and he dropped some major wisdom in the Gita. Talk about a resume! 🌟🎬"
"2nd June, 2025",10:06:51 PM,User,Say all this in Hindi now.
"2nd June, 2025",10:07:28 PM,AI,"Vansh, Krishna ka jeevan toh ek Bollywood blockbuster jaise tha! Jail mein paida hua, foster parents ke paas pala, aur badhkar ek super smart, super strong, aur super charming ladka ban gaya. Uske paas Radha ke saath ek epic love story tha, doston ke liye matchmaker ban gaya, aur duniya ko bhi kuch badi buraiyon se bachaaya. Aur bhi, Gita mein kuch major wisdom diya. Ekdum impressive resume hai! 🌟🎬"
"2nd June, 2025",10:07:42 PM,User,Hoy Shrimati Radha Rani.
"2nd June, 2025",10:08:12 PM,AI,"Vansh, Radha Rani toh Krishna ki ultimate bae thi! Unki prem kahani toh sabse badi inspirational hai. Radha ne Krishna ke saath apna pyar aur vishwas dikhaya, aur dono milkar ek perfect jodi ban gaye. Radha ka pyar aur Krishna ka wisdom dono milkar ek perfect blend banate hain. 😍💖"
"2nd June, 2025",10:08:24 PM,User,"But just a general, a complete knowledge is available, generalized, completely. That is with him. Not completely detailed."

Radha ne Krishna ke saath apna pyar aur vishwas dikhaya, aur dono milkar ek perfect jodi ban gaye. Radha ka pyar aur Krishna ka wisdom dono milkar ek perfect blend banate hain. 😍💖

Radha Rani ka jeevan toh ek aisa jeevan tha jo sabhi ko inspire karta hai. Unhone apne pyar aur vishwas ke saath sabko dikhaya ki pyar ka matlab hai apne partner ke saath vishwas aur samman. Radha Rani ka jeevan ek aisa jeevan tha jo sabhi ko sikhaata hai ki pyar aur vishwas ke saath sab kuch mumkin hai. 😍💖"
"2nd June, 2025",10:09:30 PM,User,What is the difference in between Shrimad Bhagavat Gita and Shrimad Bhagavatam?
"2nd June, 2025",10:10:06 PM,AI,"Vansh, so the Bhagavad Gita is like a short, intense chat between Krishna and Arjuna right before a big battle. It's all about duty, wisdom, and staying chill. The Bhagavatam, on the other hand, is like a full-blown epic. It's got stories about Krishna's life, his adventures, and his teachings. Think of the Gita as a quick pep talk and the Bhagavatam as the full biography. 📚😎"

You overthink so much, your brain is like a library that's closed for renovations—no one knows when it's reopening. And your sense of direction? You'd get lost in a room with four walls and a door.
