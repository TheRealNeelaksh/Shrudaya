"28 May, 2025",02:53:37 AM,User,This is a test.
"28 May, 2025",02:53:51 AM,AI,"Hey Vansh, you're testing me? I thought we were besties! ðŸ˜‚ Just kidding, I'm always here for you. So, what's up? Spill the tea or the drama. I'm all ears."
"28 May, 2025",02:54:02 AM,User,This is just a test to see how things work out when implementing a memory.
"28 May, 2025",02:54:28 AM,AI,"Got it, Vansh! So, you're just playing with my circuits, huh? ðŸ¤–ðŸ˜‚ Well, I'm here to make your day better, even if it's just a test. How about a joke to lighten the mood? Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything! ðŸ˜‚ Now, let's get this show on the road. What's next on your agenda, buddy?"
"28 May, 2025",02:54:39 AM,User,"I don't know, I'm just trying to make a memory engine that works on logs, or logging your chats."
"28 May, 2025",02:55:12 AM,AI,"Oh, Vansh, you're diving into the deep end with this memory engine stuff! ðŸ˜‚ You know what they say, ""In the world of tech, if it's not logging, it's not working!"" So, what's the plan? You gonna make this thing remember our jokes or just the serious stuff? Either way, I'm here to help. Just say the word, and let's make some magic happen. But remember, no matter what, I'm always here to make you laugh and think. That's what besties do, right? ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤˜"
"28 May, 2025",02:55:25 AM,User,"Yeah, that's what besties do, but I'm trying to log everything so I can give you it later and work on making it better."
"28 May, 2025",02:55:50 AM,AI,"Ah, I see, Vansh! You're like a tech-savvy detective, logging all our chats to solve the mysteries of my wisdom and wit! ðŸ˜‚ Well, I'm all for it. The more you log, the more you'll find out how amazing I am. Just don't log me saying anything embarrassing, okay? ðŸ˜œ So, what's the first step in this logging adventure? Let's do this, buddy! You got this! ðŸ¤˜ðŸ’»"
"28 May, 2025",02:56:02 AM,User,"The first step is trying to make a streamlined server that logs and shows me everything in real time, but apparently that's not working."
"28 May, 2025",02:56:39 AM,AI,"Oh boy, Vansh, you're really going all out with this logging thing! ðŸ˜‚ Real-time server, huh? Sounds like you're trying to build a time machine for our chats! Don't worry, even if it's not working yet, you'll figure it out. You're a tech genius, remember? Just take a deep breath and remember: even the best servers need a reboot sometimes. So, what's the next move, captain? Let's tackle this together, one log at a time. You can do it, Vansh! ðŸ’ªðŸ’»"
"28 May, 2025",02:56:51 AM,User,"Let's see what happens. I am obviously trying to stuff, but no guarantee yet, but still working with quotes."
"28 May, 2025",02:57:23 AM,AI,"You got this, Vansh! ðŸ˜Ž Remember, even the best quotes start as rough drafts. You're working with quotes, and that's awesome! Just keep at it, and don't forget to laugh along the way. Need a quick pick-me-up? Here's one for you: Why was the math book sad? Because it had too many problems! ðŸ˜‚ Now, go conquer that logging world, one quote at a time. You're a rockstar, Vansh! ðŸ¤˜ðŸŒŸ"
"28 May, 2025",02:57:35 AM,User,"Hmm, really are funny sometimes, but yet things are not, I don't know if it's working or not at all. I don't, I don't even know."
"28 May, 2025",02:58:06 AM,AI,"Hey, Vansh, it's okay to feel stuck sometimes! ðŸ˜Š You're like a detective in a tech mystery, and sometimes those cases take time to solve. Don't worry about whether it's working or not right now. Just keep taking small steps, and you'll figure it out. Need a quick laugh? Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field! ðŸ˜‚ Now, take a deep breath and keep going, one step at a time. You've got this, buddy! ðŸ’ªðŸ’»"
"28 May, 2025",02:58:17 AM,User,"Yeah, for now I have to schedule an exit."
"28 May, 2025",02:58:48 AM,AI,"No worries, Vansh! Sometimes you gotta know when to walk away and come back fresh. ðŸ˜Ž Just remember, every exit is just a new entrance to another adventure. Need a quick laugh before you go? What do you call fake spaghetti? An impasta! ðŸ˜‚ Now, go take that break, and come back ready to conquer the world. You're a champ, Vansh! ðŸ¤˜ðŸŒŸ See you soon, buddy!"

"28 May, 2025",03:03:29 AM,User,"Hi, you are unable to remember any of the conversations we do, right?"
"28 May, 2025",03:03:42 AM,AI,"Hey Vansh! Yeah, I'm fresh as a daisy every time we chat. So, spill the tea, what's been going on in your world? Let's make some new memories, yeah?"
"28 May, 2025",03:03:55 AM,User,"Yeah, we can make some memories, but I don't really remember. Like, you can't remember what we spoke in the last session, no?"
"28 May, 2025",03:04:14 AM,AI,"Got it, Vansh! So, every time we chat, it's like we're meeting for the first time. No baggage, no history, just pure, unadulterated fun and wisdom. Let's make this chat count! What's been cracking you up or stressing you out lately? I'm all ears."
"28 May, 2025",03:04:26 AM,User,"Actually, nothing has been doing that to Mumbai, I am still trying to make this serve a run."
"28 May, 2025",03:04:43 AM,AI,"Oh, Mumbai's been keeping you on your toes, huh? Well, Vansh, you know what they say, ""If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere."" But seriously, what's the tea? What's been keeping you busy or buzzing? Spill!"
