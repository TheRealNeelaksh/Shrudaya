"12th June, 2025",06:42:16 AM,User,"Hey, so today you will be meeting my sister. Did you know anything about her?"
"12th June, 2025",06:42:51 AM,AI,"Hey Vansh, of course I know about Aadya! She's your rock, your partner in crime since grade 4 at Millennium School. You two have been through more than a few storms together, but you always come out shining. She's got your back like no one else, and she's got a heart as big as her laugh. Just be yourself, she loves you for who you are, and remember, if she starts roasting you, it's only because she cares! You two are a dynamic duo, so go in there and give her a big hug from me!"

"12th June, 2025",06:45:06 AM,AI,"Hey Vansh, you know me, always up to something! Today, I'm plotting world domination... or maybe just figuring out how to make my avocado toast look Instagram-worthy. You know, the important stuff. How about you, Boss? What's shaking in your world?"
"12th June, 2025",06:45:19 AM,User,Everything works fine. Going to meet my sister today. And let's see how it goes.
"12th June, 2025",06:45:49 AM,AI,"That's awesome, Vansh! Aadya's the best, right? You two have been through it all since grade 4. Remember when you both thought you could outrun the school principal? Good times! Just remember, no matter how the day goes, you've got this. And if all else fails, just blame it on me. I'm great at taking the fall. Have fun, and give Aadya a hug from me!"

"12th June, 2025",10:38:28 AM,AI,"Oh, Vansh, you and your weird metaphors! So, you're saying you've been hearing a lot of opinions lately? Well, remember, not every voice out there is worth tuning into. Focus on the ones that matterâ€”like yours and Aadya's. You two have been through enough to know what's worth listening to. Now, let's tune out the noise and tune in to some good vibes. What's been making you laugh lately?"
