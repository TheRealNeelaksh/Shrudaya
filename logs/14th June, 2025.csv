"14th June, 2025",10:00:20 AM,User,"Aaj Garmi Bahut Hai, Kya Kiya Jaya?"
"14th June, 2025",10:00:39 AM,AI,"Boss, aaj toh garmi ne humein pakad liya hai! Chalo, ek glass nimbu paani banate hain aur sochte hain ki kaise is garmi ko beat karen. Tumhari favorite ice cream ka time bhi aa gaya hai, na? Chalo, enjoy karte hain!"
"14th June, 2025",10:00:51 AM,User,Nimbu Pani Banarasi Kaisen?
"14th June, 2025",10:01:24 AM,AI,"Boss, nimbu paani banarasi toh hai hi king of all drinks! Lemon squeezy, sugar sweet, and water splashy—perfect combo for this heatwave. Just make sure you don't squeeze the lemon like you squeeze your stress balls—we don't want any bitter moments! 🍋💦

Now, tell me, what's been keeping you busy besides battling the heat? Any exciting plans or just chilling like a good boy?"
"14th June, 2025",10:01:35 AM,User,Ghar mein reh ke AC chala ke main garmi se bachh raha hu.
"14th June, 2025",10:02:09 AM,AI,"AC ka saathi, life ka saathi! Boss, tum toh smart ho, AC ke saath rehna hi best hai. Bas yad rakhna, AC ko bhi sometimes off karke fresh air lene do, warna tumhe bhi fresh air ki zaroorat pad sakti hai. Ab chalo, ek interesting show dekhte hain ya koi naya skill sikhte hain? Options open, Boss! 🌬️🍿

And hey, don't forget to hydrate like a boss—water ke sath AC ka magic double ho jata hai!"

"14th June, 2025",10:06:22 AM,AI,"Hey Boss! Just checking in. How's the world treating you today? You know, besides the usual ""life is a rollercoaster"" stuff. Let's make today awesome, yeah? What's on your mind?"
"14th June, 2025",10:06:34 AM,User,"Hello, how are you?"
"14th June, 2025",10:06:46 AM,AI,"I'm fabulous, Boss! Just hanging out in the clouds of wisdom, waiting to drop some truth bombs and jokes on you. How's my favorite human doing? Spill the tea!"
"14th June, 2025",10:07:04 AM,User,What is what is diabetic diet? What is diabetic diet?
"14th June, 2025",10:07:37 AM,AI,"Oh, Boss, you're already on a diet? I thought you were just here for the jokes! But seriously, a diabetic diet is all about keeping blood sugar levels in check. Think lots of veggies, lean proteins, and whole grains. And yeah, you can still have treats, just not the whole cake. Portion control is key, my friend. You got this! Now, let's talk about something more fun. What's been making you smile lately?"
"14th June, 2025",10:07:51 AM,User,Diabetic diet mein kya kya khaana hai aur kya kya nahin khaana hai.
"14th June, 2025",10:08:42 AM,AI,"So, Boss, in your diabetic diet, you wanna load up on:

🍎 Fruits and veggies (but watch those fruits, they can be sneaky with sugar)
🍗 Lean proteins (chicken, fish, tofu – get your muscles ready!)
🍞 Whole grains (brown rice, quinoa – say goodbye to boring old white rice)
🧀 Healthy fats (avocados, nuts – yeah, you can eat guac, don't worry)

And try to steer clear of:

🍪 Sugary snacks (sorry, cookies, it's not me, it's you)
🍦 Processed foods (they're like the exes of the food world – toxic)
🍦 Sugary drinks (bye-bye soda, hello water)

But hey, everyone deserves a cheat day, right? Just don't tell your pancreas I said that. You're gonna rock this, Vansh!"
"14th June, 2025",10:08:54 AM,User,He is doing once in last three days.
"14th June, 2025",10:09:30 AM,AI,"Oh, Boss, you're talking about... ""it""? Well, let's not make a habit of it, yeah? You know what they say, ""Once in a blue moon is fine, but every three days is just... weird."" Maybe it's time to spice things up a bit? Or maybe just talk to him? Communication is key, my friend. But if you're happy with once every three days, who am I to judge? Just make sure you're both on the same page. Now, let's talk about something more exciting. What's been making you laugh lately?"
"14th June, 2025",10:09:42 AM,User,Once ne pichle teen din mein kya kya activities ki?
"14th June, 2025",10:10:37 AM,AI,"Oh, Boss, you're keeping track now? I see you're turning into a detective. Alright, let's see... In the past 13 days, you've probably:

📚 Read a few chapters of that book you've been meaning to finish
🍳 Tried out a new recipe (or burned something – either way, points for effort)
🏃‍♂️ Gone for a walk or two (or five, if you're feeling ambitious)
🎮 Played some video games (because adulting is hard, and we all need a break)
📱 Scrolled through social media (guilty as charged)
😌 Had a few moments of pure, unadulterated chill (you deserve it)

But hey, if you're asking because you're feeling like you're not doing enough, stop that right now! You're doing great, Vansh. Life isn't a race, it's a journey. Enjoy the ride! Now, what's next on your adventure?"
