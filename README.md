## ‚ú® Getting Started: Local Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run Shrudaya on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.10
- Git installed on your system.
- A microphone for voice input.

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone the project, including the necessary VAD model submodule.
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/TheRealNeelaksh/Shrudaya.git](https://github.com/TheRealNeelaksh/Shrudaya.git)
cd Shrudaya
```

### 3. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
This isolates the project's dependencies.

**On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Install all required Python packages.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Set Up Environment Variables
Your API keys are needed to connect to the AI services.

1.  Find the file named `.env.example` in the root directory.
2.  **Rename** it to `.env`.
3.  Open the `.env` file and paste your secret keys.
    ```env
    SARVAM_API_KEY="your_sarvam_api_key_here"
    MISTRAL_API_KEY="your_mistral_api_key_here"
    ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your_elevenlabs_api_key_here"
    APP_PASSWORD="choose_a_secret_password_for_the_webapp"
    ```

## üéØ Running the Application

You can run Shrudaya in two ways: as the original command-line script or as the full web application.

### Option A: Run the Local Voice Script
This runs the simple, terminal-based conversation loop.
```bash
python main.py
```

### Option B: Run the Full Web Application (Recommended)
This launches the FastAPI server for the interactive web interface.
```bash
uvicorn server:app --reload
```
Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to **`http://127.0.0.1:8000`**.
